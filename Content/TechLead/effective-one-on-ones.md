# Effective 1:1s

1:1s are an opportunity for you, as a tech lead, to provide coaching and guidance to your team so that they can reach their goals.

By holding effective 1:1s, you can help your team do the following:

- Share ideas and expertise
- Speak up when they have problems
- Find a path for their career development


Don't not have them
Try to have them at the same time on a regular cadence
Don't think they are not important by turning up late, rescheduling or cutting down the time
Be prepared
Don't make it a progress report
Don't just focus on 
Don't assume there is nothing going on that needs to be discussed

## Best practices

What do you care about?
What has worked well for you in the past?
Check-in?
Personality matters

How I work:


- Agenda
- Records

- Location - walking, https://www.ted.com/talks/nilofer_merchant_got_a_meeting_take_a_walk 
outside the office?
remote?
    - how are you supposed to keep records with a walking meeting?

keeping records:
create agenda, jot down topics - shared doc - for you and the team. 

follow through with actions (both of you)


## Types of 1 on 1

- reciprical reporting - what are you working on / what are they working on
- career - what do you want to do / what are you satifieds/unsafirified with
- feedback review - project/customer - how am I doing?

How long - 30 minutes - 1 hour.

GLO
Get stuff done - blockers / status update bi-weekly 

Learn - quarterly career development conversations

Open up - feedback as necessary


### Get stuff done

- make it about the team member

Be an active listener
Speak last
Don't dictate the topics/conversation

Open ended questions around Person/Project/Team/Manager
